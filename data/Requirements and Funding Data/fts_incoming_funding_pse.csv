RWDS and QADER have jointly developed a project to build on their longstanding experience in implementing similar interventions. RWDS aims to scale up the work initiated three
years ago through projects funded by CISU and Freida, a Swiss partner, emphasizing the importance of targeting single and divorced women, who are among the most marginalized
in the community. Through previous projects, RWDS recognized the significance of legal and media support as essential tools to influence attitudes, promote awareness, and support
women's rights, while also addressing the stigma surrounding these groups. Building on these learnings, RWDS prioritizes support for single and divorced women, enhancing legal
and media interventions to promote positive change in attitudes towards women's rights. QADER is building on the foundation laid by previous projects by extending support to
disabled women and children, recognizing them as some of the most marginalized segments, especially during wartime. This inclusion underscores the commitment to addressing the
needs of marginalized groups. The project also aims to tackle the multifaceted challenges faced by divorced/single mothers, including those caring for children with disabilities, and
women with disabilities aged 18-55 who are vulnerable to violence in rural areas of Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. Implemented in 15 marginalized rural communities, the project
addresses limited access to protection services, which is exacerbated by conservative settings lacking awareness and support, as well as Israeli measures that hinder access to
services, particularly impacting women with disabilities. The escalating violence in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since October 7 has significantly intensified protection
challenges for women and girls, particularly those with disabilities. In Gaza, the United Nations reports that over 1.4 million people, including women and children, have been
displaced, with many shelters overcrowded and lacking basic amenities, increasing the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and exploitation. According to UN Women, incidents of
domestic violence, sexual harassment, and other forms of GBV have surged due to the breakdown of social structures and the scarcity of protection services. Women with disabilities
face even greater difficulties, as 92% of shelters and services in Gaza are inaccessible to them, according to Humanity & Inclusion. In the West Bank, particularly in areas
experiencing frequent military incursions and settler violence, women and girls face similar risks. Movement restrictions and widespread insecurity limit their access to essential
services. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that over 25% of Palestinian households are female-headed, making these women especially
vulnerable to poverty, violence, and social exclusion during times of conflict. The war has exacerbated an already inadequate protection infrastructure for women and girls in Gaza
and marginalized West Bank communities. Humanitarian assessments reveal a severe shortage of accessible shelters, psychosocial support, and legal assistance for GBV survivors.
The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) reports that 70% of GBV survivors in Gaza lack appropriate protection services, with women with disabilities disproportionately affected—only 5%
have access to necessary support. These statistics underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions for divorced and single mothers, women with disabilities, and those caring
for family members with disabilities. Thus, the demand for psychosocial support is critical, making the planned interventions of this project both highly needed and viable, especially in
Gaza. Leveraging their expertise, RWDS and QADER focus on empowering rural women, particularly divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities, through a Human RightsBased approach guided by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The project aims to raise awareness, provide skills, and empower right-holders,
emphasizing community mobilization, family engagement, and capacity-building for protection service providers. It seeks to challenge patriarchal norms, advocate for legal reforms,
and drive societal transformation to overcome barriers to women's empowerment. The outlined results align with the project's overarching goal: to enhance the safety and well-being
of divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities in the Southern West Bank and Gaza Strip. Outcome 1: Increased awareness and improved access to psychosocial, legal, and
economic empowerment services for divorced/single mothers and women with disabilities, including those at risk of violence in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. Outcome 2: Enhanced
public attitudes and behaviors to prevent violence against single/divorced mothers and women with disabilities in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza through youth-led campaigns.
Outcome 3: Enhanced legal procedures and practices to promote the protection of single/divorced women and women/girls with disabilities who are survivors or at risk of genderbased violence in Hebron, Bethlehem, and Gaza. A set of outputs and activities has been designed under each outcome.
